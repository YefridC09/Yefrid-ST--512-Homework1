## Problem 1

A physician wanted to estimate the mean length of time µ that a patient had to wait to see him after arriving at the office. A random sample of 36 patients showed a mean waiting time of 23.4 minutes and a standard deviation of 7.2 minutes. Find a 96% confidence interval for µ.    
**R/**
```{r}
n <- 36
x_bar <- 23.4
sd <- 7.2
```



## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
